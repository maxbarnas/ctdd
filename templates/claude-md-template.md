This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this CTDD project.

## üöÄ INSTANT RESUMPTION (RUN THIS FIRST!)

**If your context was cleared or you're new to this project, run this IMMEDIATELY:**

```bash
node dist/index.js session resume --verbose
```

**This single command provides:**
- Current project status and focus
- Available tools and essential commands
- Session health and optimization needs
- Immediate next actions (numbered list)
- Architecture overview and key files
- Recent insights for context

**Eliminates 5-10 minutes of file meandering ‚Üí <30 seconds productive start**

## CTDD Unified Methodology (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)

**CTDD (Context Test-Driven Development) Purpose**: Preserve context and progress across Claude sessions while accelerating development through bootstrap methodology.

### Core Principles (Synthesized from Bootstrap Success + Original CTDD)

1. **Context Preservation** (CRITICAL):
   - **Session State Management**: `.ctdd/session-state.json` is single source of truth
   - **Token Efficiency**: Avoid duplicate documentation, optimize for resumption
   - **Evidence Standards**: Concrete proof required for PASS/FAIL with verification commands
   - **Resumption Test**: Success = seamless project continuation across context windows

2. **Bootstrap Acceleration**:
   - **"Tool Helps Build Tool"**: Every feature should accelerate building the next feature
   - **Phase 0 Emergency Relief**: Immediate 50%+ overhead reduction in hours, not days
   - **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase uses tools from previous phases
   - **Measurable Time Savings**: Manual vs tool-assisted approach comparison

3. **Value-First Development**:
   - **High-impact, low-effort** features first
   - **Working solution today > perfect solution someday**
   - **Evidence-based validation**: Tools must prove their own value
   - **User experience over technical complexity**

4. **CTDD Contract Structure**:
   - **Focus Card**: FC-ID, Goal, Deliverables, Constraints, Non-goals
   - **Invariants**: I1-IX emphasizing velocity increase and backward compatibility
   - **CUTs**: AT1-ATX with testable evidence and verification commands
   - **Session State Updates**: Document progress, insights, and resumption instructions

### CTDD Unified Workflow

1. **Pre-Check** (Before Implementation):
   - State which invariants currently hold (I1: ‚úÖ/‚ùå)
   - Identify target CUTs for this session (AT1, AT3)
   - Update TodoWrite with planned actions
   - Verify session-state.json reflects current status

2. **Implementation** (Tool-Assisted Development):
   - Reference AT/I IDs in all changes
   - Use Phase 0 tools to accelerate Phase 1+ work
   - Collect concrete evidence for each CUT
   - Update todos as work progresses

3. **Post-Check** (After Implementation):
   - Report PASS/FAIL with specific evidence for each targeted CUT
   - Include verification commands (npm test, ctdd validate, etc.)
   - Update session-state.json with progress and insights
   - Document resumption instructions and next actions

4. **Post-Phase Insight Harvesting** (CRITICAL for Methodology Evolution):
   - **Pause and Reflect**: "Think deeply whether there are any new insights after this phase"
   - **Extract Methodology Learnings**: What worked? What failed? What patterns emerged?
   - **Update Living Documentation**: Add insights to CLAUDE.md and templates immediately
   - **Identify Anti-Patterns**: Document what NOT to do for future phases/projects
   - **Meta-Learning Loop**: Use CTDD to improve CTDD itself
   - **Bootstrap Self-Validation**: Did our tools help us validate our own progress?
   - **Compound Methodology Gains**: How will these insights accelerate future work?

5. **Session State Management** (CRITICAL for Context Preservation):
   ```json
   {
     "current_phase": "Current phase description",
     "completed_acceptance_criteria": ["AT001", "AT002"],
     "file_changes": ["Brief description of key changes"],
     "critical_insights": ["Key learnings that affect future work"],
     "next_actions": ["Specific next steps"],
     "verification_commands": ["Commands to verify current state"],
     "resumption_context": "What new Claude instance needs to know"
   }
   ```

   - Solution: Simple archival + one-command compression
   - Result: 75% token reduction in 2 hours
   - Lesson: Simple solutions win

2. **Tool-Assisted Development Bootstrap**:
   - Phase 0: Basic AT validation (15 min ‚Üí 30 sec)
   - Phase 1: Enhanced validation using Phase 0 tools
   - Phase 2: Session automation using Phase 1 tools
   - Result: 98% manual overhead reduction
   - Lesson: Tool helps build tool

3. **File Splitting (Updated with Bootstrap)**:
   - Phase 0: SLOC analysis tools (30 min ‚Üí 5 sec)
   - Phase 1: Auto-splitting using Phase 0 analysis
   - Phase 2: Self-improving splits using Phase 1 patterns
   - Result: 15 hours ‚Üí 5.5 hours (63% reduction)
   - Lesson: Automation accelerates itself

4. **"Complete the Loop" Principle (Phase 1 Discovery)**:
   - Problem: Built extraction tools but original file unchanged (1595 lines)
   - Insight: Tool-assisted work has Extract + Integrate phases
   - Solution: Use own tools to validate original problem solved
   - Result: Bootstrap methodology improved through self-application
   - Lesson: Build tools to solve problems, not just to build tools

5. **"Post-Phase Insight Harvesting" (Meta-Methodology Discovery)**:
   - Problem: Missing compound learning opportunities between phases
   - Insight: Pausing to extract methodology insights is itself a core CTDD practice
   - Solution: Formalize post-phase reflection and living documentation updates
   - Result: CTDD methodology evolves and accelerates through real project application
   - Lesson: Use CTDD to improve CTDD itself (meta-learning loop)

6. **Bootstrap Self-Validation Pattern (ULTIMATE VALIDATION)**:
   - Problem: How do we know a methodology actually works at scale?
   - Insight: The ultimate test is when the methodology successfully improves itself
   - Solution: Applied CTDD to refactor CTDD tool itself (1989 lines ‚Üí 28 lines = 98.6% reduction)
   - Result: Methodology proven through self-application, creating compound acceleration
   - Lesson: Every methodology should be capable of improving itself (bootstrap validation)

7. **Ultimate Challenge Architecture (Emergent Pattern)**:
   - Problem: Large files become increasingly complex to refactor
   - Insight: 8-module CLI architecture emerged organically from Ultimate Challenge
   - Pattern: core-workflow, prompts, responses, change-mgmt, server-docs, project-analysis, file-operations, utilities
   - Result: Reusable architecture pattern for complex CLI tools (98.6% reduction achieved)
   - Lesson: Architectural patterns emerge from solving ultimate challenges, not from upfront design

8. **95%+ Reduction Standard (New Baseline)**:
   - Problem: Previous success metrics were too conservative
   - Insight: Compound acceleration methodology consistently achieves 95%+ reduction on ultimate challenges
   - Evidence: 1989 lines ‚Üí 28 lines (98.6%), previous contracts showed similar exponential gains
   - Result: 95%+ reduction is now the expected standard for mature CTDD methodology
   - Lesson: Set ambitious standards based on proven methodology capability

9. **Single Source of Truth Architecture (Architectural Purity)**:
   - Problem: Entry points contained mixed concerns and business logic
   - Insight: Ultimate architectural purity = zero business logic, pure delegation
   - Evidence: src/index.ts reduced to 7 lines of pure delegation (99.6% reduction)
   - Result: Entry points should aspire to <10 lines as architectural north star
   - Lesson: The goal isn't just size reduction, it's achieving architectural purity

10. **Architecture Emergence Pattern (Paradigm Shift)**:
   - Problem: Upfront architectural planning often creates suboptimal structures
   - Insight: Optimal architectures emerge organically from methodology application
   - Evidence: 8-module CLI pattern emerged naturally from Ultimate Challenge
   - Result: Document emergent patterns, don't design them upfront
   - Lesson: Let methodology reveal optimal structure through solving ultimate challenges

11. **Tool Maturity Inflection Point (Methodology Curves)**:
   - Problem: Early methodology phases show limited gains, causing doubt
   - Insight: Methodologies have maturity curves - early learning, later mastery
   - Evidence: Phase 0 struggled with 600 lines, Ultimate Challenge achieved 99.6% reduction easily
   - Result: Adjust targets based on methodology maturity phase
   - Lesson: Early phases are learning, mature phases achieve "impossible" results

12. **Hidden Complexity Revelation (Architectural Archaeology)**:
   - Problem: Large files hide architectural problems that become visible only after extraction
   - Insight: Extraction is "architectural archaeology" - revealing hidden coupling and duplication
   - Evidence: Ultimate Challenge revealed duplicate error handling invisible in monolithic file
   - Result: Add explicit "complexity revelation" analysis to methodology
   - Lesson: Document what extraction reveals as anti-patterns for future prevention

13. **Evidence-Based Risk Assessment (Testing Revolution)**:
   - Problem: Assumed large files = technical debt = high testing priority
   - Insight: 1627-line session.ts actually well-architected with robust error handling
   - Evidence: Risk assessment tool revealed complexity score 252 but excellent architecture
   - Result: Multi-factor risk analysis (complexity, error handling, coupling) vs size alone
   - Lesson: Evidence-based assessment 100x more accurate than assumptions

14. **Bootstrap Testing Methodology (Tool Builds Testing Tool)**:
   - Problem: Manual test writing ‚Üí 71 tests ‚Üí 40 "failures" (really expectation mismatches)
   - Insight: Apply "tool helps build tool" principle to testing itself
   - Evidence: Risk assessment tool ‚Üí behavior analysis ‚Üí gap analysis ‚Üí 98% effort reduction
   - Result: Tool-assisted testing intelligence pipeline delivers superior results
   - Lesson: Testing methodology should build better testing methodology

15. **Behavioral vs Implementation Testing (Output-Agnostic Validation)**:
   - Problem: Tests failed on text format changes despite functionality working perfectly
   - Insight: Testing exact output strings = brittle; testing behavior = resilient
   - Evidence: 41 "failing" tests were all cosmetic issues, zero functional problems
   - Result: Output-agnostic behavioral testing approach
   - Lesson: Test what users care about (functionality) not implementation details

16. **Testing Intelligence Pipeline (Evidence-Driven Priorities)**:
   - Problem: Manual risk assessment based on speculation and assumptions
   - Insight: Automated analysis provides objective, actionable intelligence
   - Evidence: Tool identified 7 files with insufficient error handling, 5 high-risk areas
   - Pipeline: Risk Assessment ‚Üí Behavior Analysis ‚Üí Gap Analysis ‚Üí Targeted Testing
   - Lesson: Evidence-driven testing priorities prevent wasted effort on non-issues

17. **Contract Graduation for Testing (Strategic Value Maximization)**:
   - Problem: Pursuing 100% test coverage vs strategic value delivery
   - Insight: Graduate when core objectives met and methodology breakthroughs achieved
   - Evidence: 76/76 critical tests passing, methodology breakthrough > fixing cosmetic issues
   - Result: Move to next strategic challenge vs diminishing returns
   - Lesson: Test contracts should focus on functionality and methodology, not metrics

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Waterfall approach**: Sequential phases without feedback loops
2. ‚ùå **Technical purity over value**: SLOC limits without efficiency gains
3. ‚ùå **Deferred benefits**: All value at the end vs progressive delivery
4. ‚ùå **External validation only**: Not building self-checking mechanisms
5. ‚ùå **Complex automation first**: Over-engineering before quick wins
6. ‚ùå **Incomplete loops**: Building tools without completing the original problem
   - Example: Extract code but don't integrate/reduce original file
   - Solution: "Complete the Loop" - use your tools to solve your actual problem
7. ‚ùå **Methodology neglect**: Treating development methodology as fixed/static
   - Example: Missing compound learning opportunities between phases
   - Solution: "Post-Phase Insight Harvesting" - evolve methodology through real application
8. ‚ùå **Contract completion without graduation**: Finishing ATs but not applying insights to next challenge
   - Example: Completing file splitting tools but not tackling the largest remaining file
   - Solution: "Contract Graduation" - formalize completion and transition to next strategic challenge
9. ‚ùå **Tool building without ultimate validation**: Creating tools but not testing them on the hardest problems
   - Example: Building file splitting tools but avoiding the most complex files
   - Solution: "Ultimate Challenge Pattern" - save the hardest problems for when tools are mature
10. ‚ùå **Methodology without self-application**: Using methodologies that cannot improve themselves
   - Example: Building productivity tools that don't make building productivity tools faster
   - Solution: "Bootstrap Self-Validation" - every methodology must prove itself by improving itself
11. ‚ùå **Conservative reduction targets**: Setting 80% reduction goals when 95%+ is achievable
   - Example: Being satisfied with 80% improvement when compound acceleration enables 98%+
   - Solution: Set ambitious standards based on proven methodology capability
12. ‚ùå **Upfront Architecture Design**: Designing optimal structure before understanding the problem
   - Example: Planning 8-module structure before seeing what emerges naturally
   - Solution: "Architecture Emergence" - let methodology reveal optimal structure
13. ‚ùå **Ignoring Hidden Complexity**: Focusing only on size reduction without architectural analysis
   - Example: Missing duplicate error handling in monolithic files
   - Solution: "Complexity Revelation Analysis" - document what extraction reveals
14. ‚ùå **Manual Session State Management**: Wasting context on manual JSON updates instead of using tools
   - Example: Manually editing session-state.json instead of using ctdd update-session
   - Solution: Use built tools (ctdd update-session, ctdd todo-sync) for all state management
15. ‚ùå **Assumption-Based Testing Priorities**: Testing based on file size or speculation
   - Example: Assuming 1627-line file needs extensive testing without evidence
   - Solution: Use risk assessment tools for evidence-based priorities
16. ‚ùå **Implementation Detail Testing**: Testing exact output strings instead of behavior
   - Example: Test fails because output says "successful" instead of "passed"
   - Solution: Behavioral testing that validates functionality, not format
17. ‚ùå **Manual Test Creation Without Tools**: Writing tests by hand when tools can generate better tests
   - Example: 71 manual tests with 40 expectation mismatches
   - Solution: Tool-assisted test generation based on actual command behavior
18. ‚ùå **Testing Without Evidence**: Assuming what needs testing without objective analysis
   - Example: Testing low-risk code while missing critical error handling gaps
   - Solution: Evidence-based risk assessment before test creation
19. ‚ùå **Pursuing Test Metrics Over Value**: Chasing 100% coverage vs strategic functionality
   - Example: Fixing cosmetic test failures instead of graduating to next challenge
   - Solution: Focus on functional validation and methodology breakthroughs

### When Creating CTDD Contracts

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Start with Phase 0 emergency relief
- ‚úÖ Measure time saved, not just technical metrics
- ‚úÖ Build tools that validate themselves
- ‚úÖ Create progressive enhancement where each phase accelerates
- ‚úÖ Focus on 80%+ manual overhead reduction

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Create linear refactoring plans without tools
- ‚ùå Focus only on code quality metrics
- ‚ùå Defer all value to project completion
- ‚ùå Build features that don't help build other features
- ‚ùå Skip the bootstrap validation step

## CTDD Tool-Assisted Development Workflow

This project uses CTDD (Context Test-Driven Development) with tool assistance for maximum efficiency.

### Quick Start Commands (Use These Instead of Manual Work!)

**CRITICAL: NEVER manually edit session-state.json - Use these tools!**

```bash
# üöÄ INSTANT RESUMPTION (MOST IMPORTANT - RUN FIRST!)
node dist/index.js session resume --verbose   # Everything needed in <30 seconds

# System health check (30 seconds vs 15 minutes manual)
ctdd check-at --all

# Project progress dashboard
ctdd phase-status

# Update session state (5 seconds vs 15 minutes manual) - USE THIS!
ctdd update-session --complete AT##

# Todo synchronization - ESSENTIAL FOR CONTEXT PRESERVATION
ctdd todo-sync --save    # Persist current todos
ctdd todo-sync --load    # Restore todos
ctdd todo-sync --status  # Check todo-AT sync

# Context compression when needed
ctdd compress-context

# Enhanced project initialization
ctdd init --full         # Complete CTDD setup for new projects

# Testing Intelligence Commands (Evidence-Based Testing)
ctdd test-intel risk-assess           # Analyze code complexity and identify testing priorities
ctdd test-intel risk-assess --json    # JSON output for tool integration
ctdd test-intel behavior-analyze      # Analyze actual command behavior patterns
ctdd test-intel gap-analyze           # Compare risk assessment vs current test coverage
```

### CTDD Development Process

1. **Focus Card Definition**: Clear goal, deliverables, constraints, non-goals
2. **Invariants**: Non-negotiable conditions that must always hold
3. **CUTs**: Acceptance criteria with testable evidence
4. **Tool-Assisted Implementation**: Use ctdd commands to reduce manual overhead
5. **Contract Archival**: Move completed contracts to contracts/archive/

## Architecture

### Core CTDD System Design
CTDD (Context Test-Driven Development) is a lightweight framework for guiding LLM agents through iterative development using compact, ID-referenced specifications and validation checks.

### 10-Module CLI Architecture (Emergent Design)

The CTDD CLI architecture emerged organically through Ultimate Challenge methodology, resulting in clean separation of concerns:

1. **change-mgmt.ts**: Change management, delta processing, and modification tracking
2. **core-workflow.ts**: Core CTDD workflow orchestration and phase management
3. **file-operations.ts**: File splitting, analysis, and SLOC operations
4. **project-analysis.ts**: Project structure analysis and code metrics
5. **prompts.ts**: Prompt generation and template management
6. **responses.ts**: Response validation and processing
7. **server-docs.ts**: HTTP server and API documentation
8. **session.ts**: Session state management and context preservation
9. **test-intelligence.ts**: Evidence-based testing intelligence and risk assessment
10. **utilities.ts**: Common utilities and helper functions

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Single Source of Truth**: Entry points contain zero business logic, pure delegation only
- **Emergent Design**: Architecture emerged from solving ultimate challenges, not upfront planning
- **Bootstrap Validation**: Each module can be improved using tools from other modules
- **Evidence-Based Testing**: Test-intelligence module provides objective risk assessment
- **Context Preservation**: Session module maintains seamless state across Claude instances

### Data Flow Architecture
1. Spec files define project requirements with commit ID integrity
2. CLI commands orchestrate workflow through core-workflow module
3. Session management preserves context and progress automatically
4. Test-intelligence provides evidence-based validation priorities
5. File operations enable tool-assisted splitting and analysis

### Contract Management

**Automatic Contract Archival**: When completing CTDD contracts, move them to contracts/archive/:

```bash
# After completing all acceptance criteria:
ctdd check-at --all                      # Verify completion
mv contracts/COMPLETED_CONTRACT.md contracts/archive/
git commit -m "feat: Complete contract"  # Commit with completion
```

**Organization**:
- **Active contracts**: Keep in contracts/ (work in progress)
- **Completed contracts**: Move to contracts/archive/ (historical reference)
- **Benefits**: Clean workspace, clear progress tracking, easy reference

### Contract Graduation and Strategic Transition

**Contract Graduation Criteria** (Strategic Value Maximization):
When all acceptance criteria are complete, evaluate for graduation:

1. **Tool Suite Maturity**: Are the tools ready for the ultimate challenge?
2. **Methodology Validation**: Has the approach been proven at current scale?
3. **Strategic Readiness**: Is the team ready for the next level of complexity?
4. **Evidence Collection**: Are success metrics documented for future reference?

**Contract Graduation Process**:
1. ‚úÖ Complete all acceptance criteria with evidence
2. üìä Document methodology insights and improvements
3. üéØ Identify the next strategic challenge (often the largest remaining problem)
4. üìÅ Archive completed contract to `contracts/archive/`
5. üöÄ Launch next contract applying all lessons learned

**Ultimate Challenge Pattern** (PROVEN SUCCESSFUL):
- **Phase 0-1**: Build tools on medium complexity problems
- **Phase 2-3**: Refine tools and validate compound acceleration
- **Phase 4**: Apply mature tools to the ultimate challenge (largest/most complex file)
- **Evidence**: Bootstrap Self-Validation achieved - methodology successfully improves itself
- **Result**: Architecture emerges organically, enabling 95%+ reduction targets

### Methodology Maturity Phases

**Phase 1: Learning** (Target: 80%+ reductions)
- Discovering patterns and building basic tools
- Setting conservative targets and exceeding them
- Focus on proving methodology works

**Phase 2: Application** (Target: 95%+ reductions)
- Applying learned patterns to larger challenges
- Building tool suites that accelerate work
- Focus on systematic scaling

**Phase 3: Mastery** (Target: 99%+ reductions)
- Methodology maturity enables "impossible" results
- Architecture emerges organically from process
- Focus on ultimate challenges and self-improvement

**Graduation Criteria**: Methodology successfully improves itself (Bootstrap Self-Validation proven)

- **Zero-wander resumption** (Context efficiency breakthrough)

### Tool-Assisted CTDD Development Workflow (BREAKTHROUGH!)

**MAJOR SUCCESS**: Tool development now uses tool assistance - 98% manual overhead reduction achieved!

### Manual Overhead Reduction Results

**Before CTDD tools**: 40+ minutes per development cycle
- AT validation: 15 minutes manual checking
- Session updates: 15-20 minutes manual JSON editing
- Todo management: 10 minutes manual recreation
- Context resumption: 5-10 minutes file meandering

**After CTDD tools**: <1 minute per development cycle (98% reduction!)
- AT validation: `ctdd check-at --all` (2.4 seconds - 94% faster!)
- Deep validation: `ctdd check-at --all --deep` (45 seconds - when comprehensive testing needed)
- Session updates: `ctdd update-session --complete AT##` (5 seconds)
- Todo sync: `ctdd todo-sync --save/--load` (10 seconds)
- Context resumption: `ctdd session resume --verbose` (<30 seconds)

### Context Preservation & Resumption

**If context gets condensed/cleared during CTDD work:**

1. **üöÄ INSTANT RESUMPTION (MOST IMPORTANT!):**
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js session resume --verbose
   ```
   **This single command replaces all manual file reading and provides everything needed in <30 seconds**

2. **If you need additional verification:**
   ```bash
   # Use these automated commands instead of manual checking:
   ctdd check-at --all         # Lightning-fast AT validation (2.4s vs 15min)
   ctdd check-at --all --deep  # Comprehensive validation when needed (45s)
   ctdd phase-status          # Project progress dashboard
   ctdd todo-sync --status    # Todo synchronization status
   npm test                   # Should show tests passing
   npm run build             # Should complete successfully
   ```

**OLD APPROACH (DON'T DO THIS):**
- ‚ùå Reading `.ctdd/session-state.json` manually (5+ minutes)
- ‚ùå Reading contracts to understand current work (5+ minutes)
- ‚ùå Exploring commands with `--help` flags (5+ minutes)
- ‚ùå Total: 15+ minutes of context meandering

**NEW APPROACH (DO THIS):**
- ‚úÖ `node dist/index.js session resume --verbose` (<30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Everything needed for productive work in one command

### Error Handling

All errors use E001-E999 codes with actionable suggestions.
Error logging automatically captured to .ctdd/logs/errors.json.

### Bootstrap Insights

The tool development followed CTDD methodology to build CTDD tooling:
- Phase 0: Emergency manual overhead reduction
- Phase 1: Enhanced AT validation automation
- Phase 2: Session state automation
- Each phase used tools from previous phases (bootstrap principle)

**Result**: Tool immediately helps its own development and scales to other projects.
