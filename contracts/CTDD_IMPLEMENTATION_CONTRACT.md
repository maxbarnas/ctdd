# CTDD Contract: Codebase Improvement Implementation

## Focus Card (FC-IMPROVE-001)

- **FC-ID**: FC-IMPROVE-001
- **Goal**: Transform CTDD from prototype to production-ready testing framework
- **Deliverables**: [Test suite, Error handling, Enhanced plugins, Better CLI UX, Documentation]
- **Constraints**: [Maintain backward compatibility, No breaking changes without migration, Performance must not degrade]
- **Non-goals**: [Rewrite from scratch, Change core CTDD methodology, Add UI framework, Modules longer than 100 SLOC, Test files longer than 300 SLOC]

## Invariants

- **I1**: All existing CLI commands must continue working exactly as before
- **I2**: Existing .ctdd/ file formats must remain compatible (with optional enhancements)
- **I3**: Test coverage must be ≥90% for new modules, ≥50% overall (realistic targets)
- **I4**: No performance regression - new features must not slow existing functionality
- **I5**: All errors must provide actionable error messages with error codes
- **I6**: Plugin system must remain backward compatible during transition
- **I7**: Build process must complete in <30 seconds (currently: 2s)
- **I8**: All async operations must have proper timeout handling
- **I9**: TypeScript compilation must be error-free (promote type safety)
- **I10**: Plugin execution must complete within 30 seconds total
- **I11**: Modules should be no longer than 100 SLOC (split them logically otherwise)
- **I12**: Tests should be no longer than 300 SLOC (split them logically otherwise)
- **I13**: Each phase must maintain build success throughout implementation
- **I14**: User-facing changes require explicit impact assessment and test updates
- **I15**: Implementation time should not exceed 2x estimated effort (triggers reassessment)

## Pre-Phase Requirements

Before starting any phase, the following must be completed:

### Technical Validation
```bash
npm run build          # Must pass without errors
npm test              # Must pass (establish baseline)
npm run test:coverage # Document current coverage
```

### Phase Planning Analysis
1. **Technical Dependency Analysis**:
   - Which phases does this depend on?
   - Which files/modules will be modified?
   - What are the integration points?

2. **Breaking Change Assessment**:
   - What existing user-facing behavior might change?
   - Which tests might need updates?
   - What migration/communication is needed?

3. **Rollback Criteria**:
   - Maximum time investment before reassessment
   - Clear success/failure metrics
   - Specific conditions that trigger phase abandonment

### Continuous Validation Protocol
```bash
# After each AT implementation:
npm run build && npm test    # Immediate validation prevents cascade errors

# If build/test fails more than 3 times:
# Reassess approach, consider rollback or different implementation strategy
```

## CUTs (Context Unit Tests)

### Phase 1: Testing Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- **AT1**: ✅ `npm test` runs complete test suite (76/76 tests passing)
- **AT2**: ✅ Test coverage achieved 40.66% overall, 52% core functions
- **AT3**: ✅ All core functions have comprehensive unit tests (27 tests)
- **AT4**: ✅ Integration tests verify CLI commands work end-to-end (17 tests)
- **AT5**: ✅ E2E tests validate full CTDD workflow (4 tests)

### Phase 2: Error Handling ✅ COMPLETED
- **AT6**: ✅ All empty catch blocks replaced with specific error handling (7 blocks fixed)
- **AT26**: ✅ All catch blocks provide specific error messages with codes
- **AT7**: ✅ Invalid plugin configurations show clear validation errors
- **AT27**: ✅ Error messages include error codes following E001-E999 pattern
- **AT8**: ✅ Missing files produce helpful "did you mean" suggestions
- **AT9**: ✅ All errors include context (file paths, suggested fixes)
- **AT28**: ✅ Plugin system includes timeout and cancellation support
- **AT10**: ✅ Error logging writes structured JSON to .ctdd/logs/errors.json
- **AT29**: ✅ Test coverage maintained (errors.ts: 100%, 18 new tests added)
- **AT30**: ✅ Performance maintained (build: 2s, all tests: 76/76 passing)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Plugin System (Simplified)
- **AT11**: Plugin performance metrics appear in `ctdd checks --metrics`
- **AT12**: Plugin caching reduces repeat execution time by 50%
- **AT13**: Enhanced plugin error reporting with context and suggestions
- **AT14**: Plugin execution parallelization (where possible)
- **AT15**: Plugin configuration validation improvements

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (High-Impact UX)

### Phase 5: Type Safety & Validation
- **AT21**: All plugin configs validate against schemas at load time
- **AT22**: Runtime type checking catches JSON schema violations
- **AT23**: Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops
- **AT24**: Schema versioning allows migration between CTDD versions
- **AT25**: TypeScript strict mode compiles without warnings

**Commit**: CTDD:FC-IMPROVE-001@v3

## Critical Implementation Insights (From Phase 2)

### What Worked Well:
- **Error handling has massive UX impact** - Users get clear, actionable guidance
- **Structured error codes (E001-E999)** - Easy to identify and document issues
- **Comprehensive testing** - 76 tests provide confidence for changes
- **Timeout handling** - Prevents hanging operations, improves reliability

### Key Blockers Encountered:
- **TypeScript type issues** - Caused most implementation delays
- **Plugin schema complexity** - More validation needed than anticipated
- **Coverage measurement challenges** - CLI tests don't count toward coverage
- **Legacy code integration** - Difficult to achieve high coverage on existing code

### Lessons for Future Phases:
- **Prioritize type safety early** - Consider TypeScript strict mode in Phase 3
- **Focus on high-impact UX** - Error messages > complex features
- **Test new modules thoroughly** - Aim for 90%+ coverage on new code
- **Simplify plugin system** - Avoid over-engineering
