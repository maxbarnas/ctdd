# CTDD Contract: Context Preservation Enhancement

## Focus Card (FC-CONTEXT-001)

- **FC-ID**: FC-CONTEXT-001
- **Goal**: Transform CTDD context preservation from manual session-state management to an automated, structured, and token-efficient system
- **Deliverables**: [Automated session state updates, Structured phase templates, Context archival system, Token-optimized preservation, Context validation tools]
- **Constraints**: [Must preserve all resumption capabilities, Backward compatible with existing session-state.json, No context loss during transitions, Maintain single source of truth principle]
- **Non-goals**: [Complete redesign of CTDD methodology, Complex UI interfaces, Real-time collaboration features, Version control integration beyond what exists]

## Invariants

- **I1**: Context resumption must be 100% reliable after any interruption
- **I2**: Session state updates must be atomic (no partial/corrupt states)
- **I3**: Token usage for context preservation must be optimized (reduce bloat)
- **I4**: Historical phase data must be archived without losing accessibility
- **I5**: Manual session state editing must be eliminated where possible
- **I6**: Context validation must catch inconsistencies automatically
- **I7**: Template-based phase documentation must be consistent and complete
- **I8**: Context preservation must scale to 10+ phases without degradation

## CUTs (Context Unit Tests)

- **AT15**: Documentation export creates readable phase summaries

**Commit**: CTDD:FC-CONTEXT-001@v1

## Deep Analysis: Current Context Preservation Issues

### Token Efficiency Problems
**Current Issue**: Session-state.json contains redundant information across multiple sections
- Acceptance criteria repeated in multiple places
- File modification details duplicated
- Historical data mixed with active context

**Impact**: Context windows fill up faster, requiring more frequent compression

### Manual Update Burden
**Current Issue**: Session state requires manual editing after each significant change
- Error-prone manual JSON editing
- Inconsistent documentation patterns
- Missing updates lead to context loss

**Impact**: High cognitive overhead, potential for mistakes

### Scalability Concerns
**Current Issue**: As phases accumulate, session-state.json becomes unwieldy
- Single file contains all historical data
- No clear separation between active and archived context
- Difficult to find specific information quickly

**Impact**: Context becomes harder to navigate and maintain

### Structure Inconsistency
**Current Issue**: No enforced templates for phase documentation
- Different phases documented differently
- Missing standard sections in some phases
- Inconsistent level of detail

**Impact**: Reduced reliability of context resumption

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Context State Machine
```typescript
// Automated state transitions with validation
interface ContextState {
  active_phase: PhaseContext
  archived_phases: PhaseArchive[]
  resumption_context: ResumptionData
  validation_checksums: ValidationData
}
```

### 2. Template-Driven Documentation
```typescript
// Structured templates for consistent documentation
interface PhaseTemplate {
  phase_id: string
  deliverables: DeliverableStatus[]
  acceptance_criteria: ATStatus[]
  key_insights: LessonLearned[]
  next_actions: ActionItem[]
}
```

### 3. Automated Archival System
```typescript
// Separate storage for completed phases
interface PhaseArchive {
  phase_summary: PhaseSummary
  key_deliverables: string[]
  lessons_learned: string[]
  resumption_data: ResumptionInstructions
}
```

### 4. Context Validation Engine
```typescript
// Automated consistency checking
interface ContextValidator {
  validateCompleteness(): ValidationResult
  checkConsistency(): ConsistencyReport
  generateResumptionTest(): ResumptionValidation
}
```
