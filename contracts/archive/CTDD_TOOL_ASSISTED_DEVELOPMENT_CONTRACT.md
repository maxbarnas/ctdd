# CTDD Contract: Tool-Assisted Self-Development

## Focus Card (FC-BOOTSTRAP-001)

- **FC-ID**: FC-BOOTSTRAP-001
- **Goal**: Transform CTDD tool development from manual bookkeeping to tool-assisted workflow using progressive bootstrap approach
- **Deliverables**: [AT validation automation, Todo sync integration, Progress dashboard, Self-guided development workflow]
- **Constraints**: [Must maintain current development velocity, Cannot break existing 76/76 tests, Bootstrap must provide immediate value, Tool must help build itself from day 1]
- **Non-goals**: [Complex automation systems before proving value, Over-engineering instead of quick wins, Breaking existing CTDD methodology, Theoretical features without immediate benefit]

## Invariants

- **I1**: Tool development velocity must increase with each phase (tool helps build tool)
- **I2**: All existing functionality must remain intact (76/76 tests passing)
- **I3**: Manual overhead must decrease by 80%+ by end of implementation
- **I4**: Each feature must provide immediate value for tool development
- **I5**: Tool must follow CTDD methodology while building CTDD methodology tools
- **I6**: Bootstrap approach must be self-validating (tool checks its own progress)
- **I7**: Implementation phases must complete in ≤5 days total
- **I8**: Tool-assisted workflow must be more efficient than manual CTDD
- **I9**: Each tool feature must demonstrably help build the next tool feature
- **I10**: Only build commands with clear, simple implementation paths (no theoretical features)

## CUTs (Context Unit Tests)

### Phase 0: Emergency Manual Overhead Reduction (Day 1)
- **AT30**: Manual AT checking reduced from 15 minutes to <2 minutes using basic verification script
- **AT31**: `ctdd check-at --all` validates all AT1-AT30 automatically with simple pass/fail output
- **AT32**: `ctdd check-at AT16` validates specific acceptance criteria with evidence collection

### Phase 1: AT Validation Automation (Day 2)
- **AT33**: AT validation uses existing verification commands (npm test, build, command existence checks)
- **AT34**: `ctdd phase-status` shows current phase progress with completion percentages
- **AT35**: Tool immediately helps its own development (AT validation used to build AT validation)

### Phase 2: Session State Automation (Days 3-4)
- **AT36**: Basic session state auto-update when AT marked complete (simple JSON manipulation)
- **AT37**: `ctdd todo-sync` persists TodoWrite state with AT mapping for resumption
- **AT38**: Session state updates reduce from manual 15+ minutes to automated 30 seconds

### Phase 3: Self-Guided Development (Days 5+)
- **AT39**: `ctdd next-at` suggests next acceptance criteria based on current progress
- **AT40**: Tool development acceleration measurably proven (time manual vs tool-assisted workflow)
- **AT41**: Complete tool-assisted CTDD workflow validated on bootstrap project itself

## Critical Implementation Insights

### Bootstrap Strategy Proven Patterns
- **Quick wins approach validated**: Phase 4 UX features showed high-impact, low-effort delivers immediate value
- **Tool-assisted acceleration**: Each automation feature should reduce manual overhead for building next feature
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with immediate pain relief, build toward full automation
- **Self-validation critical**: Tool must validate its own development to ensure methodology compliance

### Expected Blockers & Mitigation
**Potential Blockers:**
- Contract parsing complexity - *Mitigation: Start with simple regex/text parsing*
- AT validation logic - *Mitigation: Use existing verification commands as foundation*
- Todo state persistence - *Mitigation: Simple JSON file format, extend gradually*
- Integration complexity - *Mitigation: Phase approach, validate each step*

**Success Patterns to Replicate:**
- High-impact UX features over technical complexity
- Working solutions today > perfect solutions someday
- Real-world validation drives feature decisions
- Test-driven development catches edge cases early

## Quality Gates

### Phase 1 Gate
```bash
npm test                           # All 76 tests still passing
npm run build                      # No build regressions
ctdd check-at --all               # AT validation working
ctdd todo-sync --export           # Todo persistence working
ctdd phase-status                 # Progress dashboard functional
```

### Phase 2 Gate
```bash
ctdd update-progress AT32         # Auto progress updates working
ctdd phase-complete 1 --dry-run   # Phase completion automation ready
ctdd contract-sync --validate     # Contract synchronization working
ls .ctdd/session-state.json       # Auto-managed, no manual editing needed
```

### Phase 3 Gate
```bash
ctdd next-at                      # Intelligent suggestions working
ctdd dev-workflow --phase bootstrap  # Self-guided development functional
ctdd meta-validate               # Methodology compliance checking active
time ctdd check-at --all         # Performance validation (<5s)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Bootstrap Complexity
- **Risk**: Bootstrap process becomes more complex than manual approach
- **Mitigation**: Each phase must demonstrably reduce overhead, abandon features that don't deliver value
- **Validation**: Time manual process vs. tool-assisted process at each phase

### Methodology Drift
- **Risk**: Tool development diverges from CTDD principles
- **Mitigation**: AT43 meta-validation catches methodology violations
- **Validation**: Tool development must follow same CTDD patterns it automates

### Feature Creep
- **Risk**: Adding complex features instead of focusing on overhead reduction
- **Mitigation**: Maintain focus on manual overhead reduction metrics, 80%+ reduction required
- **Validation**: Each feature must pass "does this help build the next feature?" test

### Integration Fragility
- **Risk**: Tool integration breaks existing workflows
- **Mitigation**: Preserve all existing commands, add new functionality alongside
- **Validation**: All 76 tests must pass throughout implementation

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **AT31-AT45**: All acceptance criteria validated with concrete evidence
- ✅ **I1-I8**: All invariants maintained throughout implementation
- ✅ Manual overhead reduced by 80%+ with measurable time savings
- ✅ Tool development velocity demonstrably increased
- ✅ Complete tool-assisted CTDD workflow functional and proven
- ✅ Tool successfully guides its own enhancement process

**Evidence Collection**:
- `ctdd check-at --all` - Automated validation of all acceptance criteria
- `ctdd phase-status` - Progress tracking showing completion percentages
- `time` measurements - Manual vs. tool-assisted workflow comparison
- `ctdd meta-validate` - Methodology compliance verification
- Development velocity metrics - Features per day before/after tool assistance

## Meta-Development Validation

### Tool-Assisted vs. Manual CTDD Comparison
**Manual CTDD Overhead (Current):**
- AT validation: 10-15 minutes per check
- Todo management: 5-10 minutes per update
- Session state updates: 15-20 minutes per phase
- Contract synchronization: 10-15 minutes per phase
- **Total**: 40-60 minutes per development cycle

**Tool-Assisted CTDD Target:**
- AT validation: 30 seconds (`ctdd check-at --all`)
- Todo management: 1 minute (`ctdd todo-sync`)
- Session state updates: 30 seconds (automated)
- Contract synchronization: 1 minute (`ctdd contract-sync`)
- **Total**: <5 minutes per development cycle

**Success Metric**: 90%+ manual overhead reduction with maintained or improved development quality.

This contract ensures CTDD tool development follows CTDD methodology while building automation that makes CTDD methodology more efficient and accessible. The bootstrap approach creates positive feedback loops where each tool feature accelerates the development of subsequent tool features.
