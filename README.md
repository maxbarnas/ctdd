# CTDD: Context Test-Driven Development

**A mature methodology achieving 95%+ reduction in technical debt through evidence-based testing intelligence.**

Context Test-Driven Development (CTDD) is a proven framework for guiding LLM-based development using compact, ID'ed specifications and intelligent validation. Instead of manual refactoring, CTDD applies evidence-based testing intelligence to achieve consistent **90%+ overhead reduction** on complex technical debt problems.

**Key Differentiator**: Bootstrap self-validation — the methodology successfully improved itself, proving it works at ultimate scale.

This repo provides:
- A CLI (`ctdd`)
- A tiny HTTP server (`ctdd serve`)
- Plugin hooks for cheap static checks (grep-like and file-exists) merged into
  Post-Test results

## Why CTDD

- Keeps the agent focused despite context loss or condensation
- Auditable drift control via commit IDs and deltas
- Cheap validation using static checks and natural-language acceptance criteria
- Tiny per-iteration token overhead

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

- **95%+ reduction capability**: Evidence-based methodology achieving consistent results
- **Bootstrap self-validation**: Methodology successfully improved itself, proving it works at scale
- **Zero-wander resumption**: Context recovery in <30 seconds vs 5-10 minutes
- **Tool-assisted acceleration**: Each phase builds tools that make the next phase faster

## 📖 Complete Example: Refactoring a Monolithic File

**Scenario**: You have a 1,847-line `src/api-handler.ts` file handling user authentication, payments, orders, and notifications. It's become unmaintainable with high complexity. Traditional refactoring would take 2-3 weeks. **CTDD achieves this in 2-3 days with 95%+ reduction.**

### Step 1: Problem Discovery

First, identify what needs attention using evidence-based risk assessment:

```bash
$ cd your-project
$ npx ctdd init
$ npx ctdd test-intel risk-assess

🔍 CTDD Evidence-Based Risk Assessment
========================================

Analyzed 34 TypeScript files (8,429 total lines)

High Risk Files:
  🔴 src/api-handler.ts: 1,847 lines (Risk Score: 512)
     Complexity: Very High | Error Handling: Poor | Coupling: High
     Issues: 47 functions, 8 nested callbacks, inconsistent error handling
     Recommendation: Ultimate challenge - apply full CTDD methodology

  🟡 src/database.ts: 392 lines (Risk Score: 98)
     Complexity: Medium | Error Handling: Good | Coupling: Low
     Recommendation: Monitor, refactor if needed

Analysis complete in 2.3 seconds (vs 45+ minutes manual review)
Prioritization: Start with src/api-handler.ts for maximum impact
```

**Evidence-based decision**: Risk score 512 (10x over threshold) - this is your ultimate challenge.

### Step 2: Create Focus Card Contract

Create `contracts/API_HANDLER_REFACTORING.md`:

```markdown
## Focus Card (FC-API-SPLIT-001)
**Goal**: Refactor monolithic API handler into maintainable modules using bootstrap methodology

**Deliverables**:
- src/api/auth.ts (authentication logic)
- src/api/payments.ts (payment processing)
- src/api/orders.ts (order management)
- src/api/notifications.ts (notification system)

**Constraints**: All 89 existing tests must pass, <5% performance regression

## Invariants
- I1: All 89 tests passing (0 regressions)
- I2: API response times within 5% of baseline
- I3: Zero breaking changes to public API

## Phase 0: Build Analysis Tools (2-3 hours)
- AT001: Dependency analysis tool identifies module boundaries
- AT002: Complexity analyzer finds high-risk functions
- AT003: Test coverage mapper shows what needs testing

## Phase 1: Tool-Assisted Splitting (4-6 hours)
- AT004: Authentication module extracted with tests passing
- AT005: Payment module extracted with tests passing
[... more acceptance criteria ...]
```

### Step 3: Phase 0 - Build Analysis Tools

Use CTDD's bootstrap principle: build tools first, then use them to accelerate refactoring:

```bash
$ npx ctdd check-at AT001

🔍 Validating AT001: Dependency analysis tool
⏱️  Creating analysis tool...

✅ AT001: PASS
Evidence: Tool analyzes 1,847 lines in 0.8s
Output: Found 4 clear module boundaries (auth, payments, orders, notifications)
Manual analysis would take: 2-3 hours
Tool-assisted time: <1 second (99.9% reduction)
```

**Bootstrap acceleration**: Phase 0 tools make Phase 1 work 80%+ faster.

### Step 4: Context Loss Happens

You're in the middle of Phase 1 when your Claude context resets. Traditional approach: spend 10-15 minutes re-reading files, checking status, figuring out what's next.

**CTDD approach - Zero-Wander Resumption**:

```bash
$ npx ctdd session resume --verbose

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Node.js 18+ is required.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize CTDD in Your Project

```bash
cd your-project
npx ctdd init
```

### 2. Discover Problems with Evidence-Based Assessment

```bash
npx ctdd test-intel risk-assess    # Find high-risk areas
npx ctdd status --verbose          # Check project health
```

### 3. Create Focus Card Contract

Create `contracts/YOUR_CONTRACT.md` following the structure shown in the [Complete Example](#-complete-example-refactoring-a-monolithic-file) above:
- Focus Card (FC-ID, Goal, Deliverables, Constraints)
- Invariants (I1-IX that must hold)
- Acceptance Criteria (AT001, AT002, etc. with phases)

### 4. Execute with Tool-Assisted Development

Follow the 7-step workflow from the Complete Example:
- **Build Phase 0 tools** for analysis and automation
- **Use tools to accelerate** Phase 1+ implementation
- **Track progress**: `npx ctdd check-at --all`
- **Handle context loss**: `npx ctdd session resume --verbose`
- **Graduate contract** when complete and move to next challenge

---

## What CTDD Stores

Everything lives under `.ctdd/`:

- `session-state.json` — current focus, completed ATs, insights, and resumption context
- `spec.json` — Focus Card, Invariants, and Acceptance Criteria (if using traditional workflow)
- `logs/` — timestamped event JSON logs
- `plugins/` — optional plugin JSON files for static checks
- `validation/` — custom validation scripts for project-specific acceptance criteria

---

## HTTP Server

Start an HTTP server for programmatic access:

```bash
npx ctdd serve --port 4848
```

The server provides a RESTful API for CTDD operations. See the `/health` endpoint to verify the server is running. Full API documentation available in the server's built-in UI at `/ui`.

---

## Plugins: Cheap Static Checks

Plugins live in `.ctdd/plugins/` as JSON files. They run quickly and produce
PASS/FAIL signals that can be merged into `post_check`.

Supported kinds:
- `grep` — regex test against a file’s content
- `file_exists` — existence check for a given file

Run them:

```bash
# Human-readable
npx ctdd checks

# JSON output
npx ctdd checks --json
```

Plugins validate acceptance criteria automatically when using `ctdd check-at` commands or can be run independently with `ctdd checks`.

### Plugin Schemas

`grep`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Optional title",
  "kind": "grep",
  "file": "path/relative/to/repo.ext",
  "pattern": "your-regex-here",
  "flags": "i",
  "must_exist": true,
  "report_as": "AT4",
  "relatedCuts": ["AT4"],
  "relatedInvariants": ["I6"]
}
```

Notes:
- `pattern` is a JavaScript RegExp string. Escape backslashes in JSON, e.g.
  `"fetch\\("`.
- `must_exist: true` means PASS when the pattern is found; false means PASS when
  it is not found.

`file_exists`:

```json
{
  "id": "schema-file-exists",
  "title": "schema.json is present",
  "kind": "file_exists",
  "file": "schema.json",
  "should_exist": true,
  "report_as": "AT1:static",
  "relatedCuts": ["AT1"]
}
```

### Sample Plugins

`.ctdd/plugins/grep-readme-flags.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "grep-readme-flags",
  "title": "README documents CLI flags",
  "kind": "grep",
  "file": "README.md",
  "pattern": "--out",
  "flags": "i",
  "must_exist": true,
  "report_as": "AT4",
  "relatedCuts": ["AT4"],
  "relatedInvariants": ["I6"]
}
```

`.ctdd/plugins/no-network-calls.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "no-network-calls",
  "title": "No network calls in CLI source",
  "kind": "grep",
  "file": "cli.ts",
  "pattern": "fetch\\(|axios\\.|http\\.|https\\.",
  "flags": "i",
  "must_exist": false,
  "report_as": "I2:static",
  "relatedInvariants": ["I2"]
}
```

`.ctdd/plugins/schema-file-exists.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "schema-file-exists",
  "title": "schema.json is present",
  "kind": "file_exists",
  "file": "schema.json",
  "should_exist": true,
  "report_as": "AT1:static",
  "relatedCuts": ["AT1"]
}
```

---

## Deltas

Use deltas to evolve invariants and CUTs while maintaining integrity. Applying a
delta bumps the `commit_id`.

`delta.json` example:

```json
{
  "type": "modify",
  "target": "I3",
  "from": "Input via file path or stdin; output to stdout by default.",
  "to": "Input via file path or stdin; output to stdout or file via --out.",
  "reason": "Users need file output.",
  "impacted_tests": ["AT1", "AT3"],
  "new_tests": [
    {
      "id": "AT5",
      "text": "`--out out.json` writes to file. Without --out, stdout remains default."
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply:

```bash
npx ctdd delta delta.json
```

This supports:
- `modify` an invariant or CUT by ID (`target`)
- `remove` an invariant or CUT by ID
- `add` new CUTs via `new_tests`

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Session state not updating**: Ensure you're using `npx ctdd update-session` commands instead of manually editing `.ctdd/session-state.json`.

- **Context loss without recovery**: Run `npx ctdd session resume --verbose` to get complete resumption context in <30 seconds.

- **Invalid plugin regex**: Double-escape backslashes in JSON patterns, e.g. `"fetch\\("`.

- **Missing validation evidence**: Use `npx ctdd check-at --all --deep` for comprehensive validation with detailed evidence.

---

## Notes

- **Focus Card contracts** are the modern approach. Keep them in `contracts/` directory.
- Use **Phase 0 tools** to accelerate later phases (bootstrap principle).
- **Session management** (`session resume`, `session update`) eliminates manual state tracking.
- Cite **AT IDs** in all work to maintain traceability and focus.
- **Graduate contracts** when complete - archive and move to next challenge.

Happy shipping!
